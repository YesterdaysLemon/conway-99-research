# Reproducing results

## Trust model

Discovery code may be complicated, optimized, randomized, or wrong. A result
is promoted only when a small independent checker validates a complete
certificate using exact arithmetic.

The minimum positive certificate is a 99-vertex edge list or adjacency matrix.
The canonical validator checks, from scratch:

1. input syntax and vertex count;
2. simplicity, symmetry, and zero diagonal;
3. degree 14 at every vertex;
4. exactly one common neighbor for every edge;
5. exactly two common neighbors for every nonedge; and
6. the integer matrix identity `A^2 = 12 I - A + 2 J`.

Checks 3--5 and check 6 are deliberately redundant implementations of the
same mathematics. A second validator should use a different representation or
language.

## Environment policy

- Pin interpreter, solver, and package versions in every run manifest.
- Record operating system, CPU, wall time, command, random seed, input hashes,
  output hashes, and Git commit.
- Keep exact integer/rational artifacts; floating-point output can guide a
  search but cannot certify a claim.
- Calibrate encodings on known strongly regular graphs and known infeasible
  parameter sets before running the target instance.
- Verify SAT/UNSAT results independently. For UNSAT, retain a checkable proof
  artifact such as LRAT when technically feasible.

## Commands

The initial scaffold intentionally contains no claimed search result. Commands
will be added alongside the first independent checker and calibration suite;
until then, `STATUS.yaml` remains the authoritative machine-readable status.

## Artifact retention

Small certificates and verification reports belong in Git. Large CNF, LRAT,
solver logs, and checkpoints should be stored in a content-addressed release or
archive. Commit a manifest containing cryptographic hashes and retrieval URLs.
Never treat an unavailable artifact as verified evidence.
