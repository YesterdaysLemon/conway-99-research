# Wave 29 detached clean-clone replay

Date: 2026-07-24

Verdict: **PASS**

Integration commit:
`ae8fd70baaeb35302f957653e20ad710e5e77281`

Public baseline:
`aadc0dafce387233fc16406cc9822f069becd645`

The replay used a new `--no-hardlinks` local clone, checked out the
integration commit in detached-HEAD state, and wrote regenerated results
outside the clone. The source and clone copies of the integration-commit
object had identical SHA-256 content hashes but different NTFS file
identifiers, and each hardlink list contained only its own path. The
mathematical replay was offline.

Runtime:

```text
Python 3.13.14
Windows PowerShell 5.1.26100.8875
```

## Mathematical suites

Both Wave 29 suites passed:

| package | tests |
|---|---:|
| submitted single-lattice endpoint exclusion | 18 |
| independent hostile verifier | 27 |
| **total** | **45** |

The replay retained the exact scope wall:

```text
S0=K12 orthogonal_sum LAMBDA(F) full endpoint origin: REFUTED (VERIFIED)
every other determinant-729 lattice: UNKNOWN
h=729 row / n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty: UNKNOWN
```

## Deterministic regeneration

Both entry points wrote fresh JSON files outside the clone. Each result was
compared byte for byte with its tracked counterpart:

| tracked result | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `attempts/wave29-s0-frame-exclusion/exact-results.json` | `7a85c5321b5e91365c246dff7bae9264cc82494da5c866b1b351511099f6638c` |
| `verification/wave29-s0-frame-exclusion/independent-results.json` | `c0418cec88915089d6cc2e29735ca3e7bc425cfcd2b3ce09a78a707e36e0aa04` |

Both comparisons passed.

## Manifest and central-ledger gates

All 19 entries in the three Wave 29 manifests validated:

```text
attempts/wave29-s0-frame-exclusion/artifact-manifest.sha256
verification/wave29-s0-frame-exclusion/artifact-manifest.sha256
verification/wave29-s0-literature-audit/artifact-manifest.sha256
```

The central and repository checks also passed:

```text
claims:                              71 unique
obligations:                         65 unique
claim/obligation evidence paths:      0 missing
status path/SHA-256 pairs:           263 matching
central BibTeX keys:                  73 unique
retained Wave 29 source records:      16 covered
tracked Markdown files:              275 checked
local Markdown links:                263 resolving
Wave 29 release-diff files:           32 UTF-8, LF-only, NUL-free
```

The status wall remained exact:

```text
project_status: EXPLORATORY
resolution_claim: NONE
target_result: UNKNOWN
conditional_n3_lower_bound: 708
n3_708_excluded: false
determinant_rows_excluded: 0
novelty_status: UNKNOWN
```

## Exact-blob privacy gate

The privacy check read Git blob bytes, not only worktree text. It scanned:

```text
integration release tree:  841 files, 13,396,726 bytes
unpublished range:           4 commits
range object census:        49 objects
new blob census:            32 blobs, 739,355 bytes
```

The unpublished range was
`aadc0dafce387233fc16406cc9822f069becd645..ae8fd70baaeb35302f957653e20ad710e5e77281`.
The scan checked both the full release tree and every new blob in the range
for OpenAI and GitHub token shapes, AWS access-key shapes, private-key
headers, credentialed URLs, and local Windows or Unix user paths. It also
scanned the four commit messages. It found zero matches.

No tracked PDF, HTML, archive, or office-document payload was present. No
blob exceeded 5 MiB. The largest release blob was the pre-existing structured
Wave 28 simultaneous-neighbor result at 654,824 bytes.

## Repository integrity

`git status --porcelain=v1`, `git diff --check`, and the full unpublished
range `git diff --check` were empty after the replay. `git fsck --full
--strict` returned exit code zero. Because the no-hardlink clone copied the
source object's unreachable local history, `git fsck` listed pre-existing
dangling objects; it reported no corrupt, missing, or invalid reachable
object.

## Scope

This replay verifies reproducibility and publication hygiene for the scoped
Wave 29 claim. It does not classify other even positive-definite rank-44
lattices satisfying the scaled-dual condition, exclude the determinant-729
row or `n3=708`, improve `n3>=708`, construct a marked 231-vector endpoint
frame or graph, resolve Conway-99, or establish novelty. All broader statuses
remain `UNKNOWN`.
