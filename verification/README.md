# Independent verification

Verification code must be small, deterministic, exact, and independent of the
search implementation where practical. Reports should include commands,
versions, hashes, expected failures on mutated fixtures, and a clear verdict.
This file is a selected orientation index, not a chronologically complete
catalog of every verification artifact; the repository map and dated
subdirectories remain authoritative for omitted waves.

## Baseline validator

`check_srg.py` accepts a strict `srg-edge-list-v1` JSON certificate. It uses
only the Python standard library and validates the graph twice: first with
adjacency-set intersections, then by evaluating the integer adjacency-matrix
identity entry by entry. The parser rejects duplicate object keys, unknown or
case-varied keys, Boolean endpoints, loops, and duplicate undirected edges.

Calibrate it on the 3-by-3 rook graph, an `srg(9,4,1,2)`:

```powershell
python verification/check_srg.py `
  verification/fixtures/rook-3x3.srg.json `
  --vertices 9 --degree 4 --lambda 1 --mu 2
python -m unittest discover -s verification -p "test_*.py" -v
```

The Conway defaults are `(99,14,1,2)`, so a future target certificate needs no
parameter flags.

`Check-Srg.ps1` is a second implementation. It independently parses the JSON
and checks the graph through .NET hash sets under Windows PowerShell 5.1 or
newer:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File verification/Check-Srg.ps1 `
  -Certificate verification/fixtures/rook-3x3.srg.json `
  -Vertices 9 -Degree 4 -AdjacentCommon 1 -NonadjacentCommon 2
```

## Small DRUP checker

`check_drup.py` is an independent, clarity-first checker for textual DRUP
proofs. It checks every addition by reverse unit propagation and requires a
verified empty clause. It is suitable for calibration and auditing encoder/
solver integration. A target-scale nonexistence claim should also use a mature,
pinned proof checker and preferably an LRAT conversion/check.

```powershell
python verification/check_drup.py path/to/instance.cnf path/to/proof.drup
```

## Mature LRAT calibration

The external proof path is calibrated separately with pinned CaDiCaL 3.0.1,
`drat-trim`, and `lrat-check` source commits. Both complete `pair_count=3`
branch-unit CNFs were accepted after DRAT-to-LRAT conversion. Exact versions,
commands, artifact hashes, and the target-scope warning are recorded in
`2026-07-22-lrat-calibration.md`.

This calibration does not make an embedded-solver `UNSAT` result evidentiary.
A target claim still requires retained proofs for a proved complete cover and
independent replay of every artifact.

## Conditional `N3` joint-cover checker

`n3-joint-cover/verify.py` is a standard-library verifier for the strict JSON
certificate describing the 12 matching orbits after canonical `N3`
normalization. It independently enumerates the full rooted scaffold
stabilizer, all 945 compatible matchings, orbit-stabilizer products, a Burnside
checksum, the legacy-fiber diagnostic, and SAT literal numbering.

```powershell
python verification/n3-joint-cover/verify.py
python verification/n3-joint-cover/verify.py `
  verification/n3-joint-cover/n3-joint-cover.json
```

The parser rejects duplicate keys, booleans masquerading as integers, unknown
fields, and non-standard JSON constants. This certificate proves only the
conditional finite branch cover. It neither establishes the upstream `N3`
occurrence theorem nor solves a target branch.

## Conditional refined `N3` checker

`n3-refined-cover/verify.py` independently reconstructs the order-768 parent
stabilizer, its twelve matching orbits, the order-384 oriented subgroup, and
all 78 orbits on the `945 * 11 = 10,395` refined states. It also derives the
forced coordinate profile, rebuilds SAT literal numbering, checks every
orbit-stabilizer product and a Burnside sum of 29,952, and enforces a strict
JSON schema.

```powershell
python verification/n3-refined-cover/verify.py
python verification/n3-refined-cover/verify.py `
  verification/n3-refined-cover/n3-refined-cover.json
```

The checker uses only the Python standard library and does not import search
code. Its `PASS` establishes the conditional symmetry case split only; it is
not a SAT/UNSAT result for any branch.

## `N3` count-bound checker

`n3-count-bound/verify.py` checks the exact arithmetic behind the auxiliary
opposite-edge graph consequence. It exhausts the sub-24 degree-sequence cases,
enumerates every forced local model for the remaining 18-edge case, rebuilds
the twelve branch degree/signature table from the verified joint certificate,
enumerates all 10,395 perfect matchings, and independently derives the
normalized six-vertex boundary profile.

```powershell
python verification/n3-count-bound/verify.py
```

The accompanying human proof establishes why the auxiliary graph has the
properties checked by the script. The resulting `n3 >= 24` is conditional on
the target-specific theorem forcing an `N3`; it is a necessary bound, not a
resolution of Conway-99.

## `N3` side-incidence checkers

`n3-side-incidence/verify.py` checks the Wave 7 active-triangle reduction and
explicitly enumerates the complement-component point patterns forced by
`n3=24` and `n3=27`. `n3-side-incidence/audit_generic.py` is a separate
implementation that generates every clique family, permits unused complement
edges, enforces disjoint intersection resources, and adds singleton fillers.

```powershell
python verification/n3-side-incidence/verify.py
python verification/n3-side-incidence/audit_generic.py
```

Both reproduce support maxima `6`, `9`, and `8`, giving the conditional
necessary bound `n3>=30`. The human proof supplies the upstream graph-theoretic
reduction; neither finite checker is a Conway-99 existence or nonexistence
certificate.

## `N3=30` equality exclusion

`n3-equality/verify.py` checks the exact arithmetic accompanying the Wave 8
classification-free proof: the unique ten-triangle `q=2` equality profile,
the fixed-endpoint count four, the point-size equations, the cubic component
orders, the forbidden internal crossing, and the strengthened global and
branch-local bounds.

```powershell
python verification/n3-equality/verify.py
python -m unittest verification.test_n3_equality -v
```

`n3-equality/audit_exhaustive.py` is an optional slow, solver-free secondary
audit archived verbatim from an independent lane. It generates every
normalized labeled cubic graph on ten vertices, recovers all 21 isomorphism
types, enumerates 674,880 point-clique families, and checks the committed JSON
certificate byte-for-byte. A replay takes about five minutes under the pinned
environment.

```powershell
python verification/n3-equality/audit_exhaustive.py `
  --check verification/n3-equality/n3-30-audit.json
```

The human derivation and adversarial audit establish why these finite
conditions follow from the Wave 6/7 framework. The resulting `n3>=33` is a
conditional necessary bound; it does not resolve Conway-99.

## `N3=33` equality exclusion

`n3-33-equality/verify.py` checks the Wave 9 classification-free proof's
finite steps: both active-`q` profiles, the labeled singleton crossing
obstruction, the point-size equations, the forced local `K5`, every residual
`K6`-minus-matching choice, and the strengthened global and branch bounds.

```powershell
python verification/n3-33-equality/verify.py
python -m unittest verification.test_n3_33_equality -v
```

Two optional standard-library programs give a materially different exhaustive
audit. They enumerate all 266 quartic types on eleven vertices and all 610
admissible point-clique families; the second program independently
canonicalizes the graph types, regenerates the family set with a different
recursion, checks every contradiction witness, and rejects certificate
mutations. The connected catalog is an external House of Graphs/Meringer
input, so it is attributed and hashed rather than redistributed.

```powershell
$wave9Catalog = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "11_4_3.g6.gz"
$wave9Certificate = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "n3-33-audit.json"
$wave9Replay = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "n3-33-replay.json"
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://houseofgraphs.org/data/quartics/11_4_3.g6.gz" `
  -OutFile $wave9Catalog

python verification/n3-33-equality/audit_exhaustive.py `
  --catalog $wave9Catalog --certificate $wave9Certificate `
  --git-commit 19f27d1ede9cdb0b4110540f52eeb3ad9c94cc94
python verification/n3-33-equality/verify_exhaustive.py `
  --catalog $wave9Catalog --certificate $wave9Certificate `
  --output $wave9Replay
```

The expected compressed catalog hash is
`05ee6bb0c2b40d63d5c44efc8e89ed1c0a381a170d81a3d052749c8edf6b14fd`.
Exact deterministic census digests and the external-source boundary are in
`n3-33-equality/n3-33-census-manifest.json`. The resulting `n3>=36` remains a
conditional necessary bound, not a Conway-99 resolution.

## `N3=36` equality exclusion

`n3-36-equality/verify.py` checks the Wave 10 proof's finite steps: all three
active profiles, singleton forcing, local point types and crossings, the
common-point obstructions, all seventy labeled cubic graphs on six vertices,
the rook-graph parameters, the line-graph-twin endpoint configuration, the
three forced triangle-group pairings, and the strengthened bounds.

```powershell
python verification/n3-36-equality/verify.py
python -m unittest verification.test_n3_36_equality -v
```

The committed support certificate is a separate finite audit of the sole
all-size-two `2K6` branch. The primary program decomposes the degree-two
bipartite supports into two permutation matchings. The independent verifier
constructs the complementary matching recursively and imports no code from
the primary implementation. Both recover exactly 216 masks with SHA-256
`6659fe1972cbacc6980a9792557714730572817b43224b5f1fac24bb0c4ca61a`.
Every abstract mask passes the auxiliary-`H` checks and has eighteen decisive
original-SRG rook-saturation violations.

```powershell
python verification/n3-36-equality/verify_support.py `
  --certificate verification/n3-36-equality/n3-36-support.json
python -m unittest verification.test_n3_36_support -v
```

To regenerate a scratch certificate from the technical commit:

```powershell
$wave10Certificate = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "n3-36-support.json"
python verification/n3-36-equality/audit_support.py `
  --certificate $wave10Certificate `
  --git-commit 2194c2b68ebd5c34491d64f15d30f1a3597baa74
python verification/n3-36-equality/verify_support.py `
  --certificate $wave10Certificate
```

The reduction from a putative graph to this finite domain is human-checked and
recorded separately. The census is not a standalone Conway-99 certificate.
The resulting `n3>=39` is a conditional necessary bound, and the target remains
`UNKNOWN`.

## `N3=39` equality exclusion

`n3-39-equality/verify.py` checks the Wave 11 proof's finite steps and exact
semantic witnesses: the four active profiles, singleton forcing, point-size
expansion, all `3^8` rooted size-four petal words, all `2^6` rooted
size-three words, literal forced `K`/`U` edge sets, forbidden point owners,
final parity, and the strengthened global and branch bounds.

```powershell
python verification/n3-39-equality/verify.py
python -m unittest -v verification/test_n3_39_equality.py
```

The committed local replay is a second layer. The primary generator explicitly
constructs canonical point sets, point-clique edges, singleton-forced
complement edges, and owner-intersection witnesses. The independent verifier
imports no primary code, uses integer-coded enumeration and a closed crossing
table, freezes nine stream hashes, and attacks the result with eight mutations.

```powershell
python verification/n3-39-equality/verify_local.py `
  --certificate verification/n3-39-equality/n3-39-local.json
python -m unittest -v verification/test_n3_39_local.py
```

The certificate contains 8,907 records and has combined stream SHA-256
`452850018ad13362694f5bfff2e4beac03288a113a0391c3456a47cd6fbfe9a1`.
Its canonical-LF outer JSON has SHA-256
`4cd23939cfb8ec5080b57fb0626e9579b68250a219ea17876a8e1f4066ad2261`;
the exact detached-clone replay is recorded in
`2026-07-22-wave11-clean-clone.md`.
Its premise stream explicitly binds `K=overline(L)`, 6-regularity, point-clique
membership, linearity, the common-point rule, and the degree-zero-or-two
crossing law. This remains a conditional replay companion to the human proof,
not a standalone Conway-99 nonexistence certificate. The resulting `n3>=42`
is a necessary bound and the target remains `UNKNOWN`.

## `N3=42` equality exclusion

`n3-42-equality/verify_reduction.py` independently checks the proof-side finite
steps: all six active profiles, the degree-three obstruction, both size-four
flower counts, the size-three `t` inequalities, the `(2,3,3)` fixed-point
contradiction, the cubic `K3,3`/open-twin obstruction, and the strengthened
global and branch bounds. Its bound output is guarded by an explicit external
support-exclusion premise.

```powershell
python verification/n3-42-equality/verify_reduction.py
python -m unittest -v verification/test_n3_42_reduction.py
```

The remaining all-size-two branch is checked by a separate proof-producing
support search and a set-based certificate replayer that imports neither the
builder nor the discovery code. The replay requires Meringer's official
`14_3_4.scd` archive, expected SHA-256
`6f3e9cf2b7e0d85c5df59c1638ab9d2fddbfc9905c49b35da01cc892f847e9a0`.
The archive has no stated redistribution license and is intentionally ignored;
download it from the official URL recorded in `REPRODUCING.md`.

```powershell
python verification/n3-42-equality/verify_support_certificate.py `
  --certificate verification/n3-42-equality/n3-42-support-certificate.json `
  --scd verification/n3-42-equality/14_3_4.scd `
  --graph6 attempts/wave12-computation/n3-42-cubic-trianglefree-14.g6 `
  --mutations
```

The certificate has SHA-256
`8115b5f34568a463952afc399bc22db927121f3f1aa28cfc33ae191ea93dc68a`.
The independent catalog bridge checks 110 connected and two disconnected cubic
triangle-free types; four survive the mandatory-degree filter, and all four
support rejection trees replay with zero survivors. The combined adversarial
audit records the conditional strengthening `n3>=45` and
`induced_C6_count>=209331`. It does not resolve Conway-99, and novelty remains
`UNKNOWN`. The detached full-suite replay and byte-identical regeneration are
recorded in `2026-07-22-wave12-clean-clone.md`.

## `N3=45` equality exclusion

`n3-45-equality/verify.py` independently reconstructs the nine active
profiles, mixed order-fourteen reductions, order-fifteen flower census, four
rooted modes, type-`223` parity obstruction, type-`111` saturation
obstruction, and final degree-zero-or-four handshake contradiction. Its
mutation mode attacks the imported premise boundary.

```powershell
python verification/n3-45-equality/verify.py --mutations
python -m unittest -v verification/test_n3_45_audit.py
```

`n3-45-equality-b/audit_semantics.py` is a second semantic reconstruction. It
froze `precomparison-verdict.md` before reading the first audit and then found
no disagreement. Both audits pass only the conditional equality exclusion:

```text
n3 >= 48,
induced_C6_count >= 209334,
Conway-99 = UNKNOWN,
novelty = UNKNOWN.
```

The companion SAT bundle is audited separately. The original bundle retains a
public FAIL report under `2026-07-22-wave13-computation-audit.md`. Its repaired
v2 artifacts pass `n3-45-computation-repair/independent_repair_audit.py` and
six focused regressions:

```powershell
python verification/n3-45-computation-repair/independent_repair_audit.py
python -m unittest discover `
  -s verification/n3-45-computation-repair -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The repair audit independently reproduces all 17 formula hashes, checks the
1,141,796-clause positive diagnostic, certifies its 18 deliberately omitted
common-point violations, verifies direct artifact provenance, and rejects 31
hostile mutations. The historical 15-test suite now loads the failed baseline
directly from commit `066d9c7fcf593c3b9d35cfef1031dbd9daab4145`, while
the repaired 12-test suite exercises the current files. No negative proof
trace was emitted or checked, so every solver-negative branch remains
`UNSAT_UNVERIFIED`; none is used in the human proof. The detached clean-source
replay at `2026-07-22-wave13-clean-clone.md` records 52 code tests, 12 focused
Wave 13 tests, 104 verification tests, and byte-identical census and positive
diagnostic regeneration.

## `N3=48` frontier reduction

`n3-48-proof/independent_reconstruction.py` independently rebuilds the twelve
active profiles, inherited three-profile filter, order-fourteen and
order-fifteen mixed-profile contradictions, and order-sixteen local-mode
arithmetic. `n3-48-proof/audit_countermodel.py` separately reconstructs the
explicit all-size-two active/local/support object and attacks it with five
semantic mutations.

```powershell
python -B verification/n3-48-proof/independent_reconstruction.py
python -B verification/n3-48-proof/audit_countermodel.py `
  attempts/wave14-proof-a/all2-active-countermodel.json
```

The proof audit passes the scoped reduction to an `r=16`, all-`q=2` residual
with point sizes two or three, eight surviving size-three modes, `H`-degrees
zero or four, and exact twofold support coverage. The positive object shows
that the listed active constraints alone are not contradictory; it is not a
partial or complete Conway graph. Exclusion of `n3=48` remains `UNKNOWN` at
this checkpoint.

The computation lane is audited independently by
`n3-48-computation/independent_audit.py`. It reconstructs all thirteen formula
streams, checks the full positive candidate and two weakened controls, binds
file and semantic provenance, and rejects 29 hostile mutations.

```powershell
python -B verification/n3-48-computation/independent_audit.py
python -B code/wave14_n3_48_test.py -v
```

The archived JSON output is deterministic under replay. The scan status is
`1 SAT_CANDIDATE`, `7 UNSAT_UNVERIFIED`, `1 BUDGET_UNKNOWN`, and
`2 TIMEOUT_UNKNOWN`; negative solver exits are explicitly non-evidentiary.
The literature/status audit also keeps the target and novelty `UNKNOWN`.
The detached clean-source replay, four byte-identical regenerations, and the
pre-release timestamp-determinism repair are recorded in
`2026-07-23-wave14-clean-clone.md`.

## `N3=48` global exclusion

Wave 15 brings the full SRG equations back into the Wave 14 residual. The
active original-vertex set has order at most 24 and induced minimum degree at
least six. The target spectrum gives

```text
2e(X) <= 3|X| + |X|^2/9,
```

so minimum degree six forces `|X|>=27`, a contradiction. An independent
outside-degree second-moment argument reaches the same obstruction.

```powershell
python -B attempts/wave15-global-lift/verify_subset_moment_certificate.py `
  attempts/wave15-global-lift/subset-moment-certificate.json
python -B -m unittest -v `
  attempts/wave15-global-lift/test_subset_moment.py
python -B verification/n3-48-global-lift/independent_check.py

$wave15Python = (Resolve-Path '.venv\Scripts\python.exe').Path
Push-Location verification/n3-48-global-lift

Pop-Location

python -B attempts/wave15-algebraic/exact_checks.py `

  --artifact attempts/wave15-algebraic/exact-checks.json
python -B -m unittest -v `
  verification/n3-48-algebraic/test_independent_check.py
```

The two discovery lanes and their separate adversarial audits pass 5, 11,
and 7 focused tests. The global certificate and independent regeneration are
byte-identical canonical-LF files. The first CRLF/public-LF mismatch is kept
at baseline commit `522260a` and repaired at `874af27`; the algebraic lane's
ambiguous weighted-moment key is also preserved and re-audited. The verified
conditional consequence is

```text
n3 >= 51,
induced_C6_count >= 209337,
Conway-99 = UNKNOWN,
novelty = UNKNOWN.
```

The detached clean-source replay at
`2026-07-23-wave15-clean-clone.md` records the full historical suites, all 23
focused Wave 15 tests, all 18 frozen file hashes, byte-identical canonical-LF
certificate regeneration, clean detached status, and `git fsck`.

## `N3=51` equality exclusion and active-local archive

Wave 16 independently verifies a shorter global obstruction. Sixteen raw
`sum q=34` profiles reduce to four. Their indexed active original-vertex set
has order at most 25, while exact size-two endpoint crossings and distinct
triangle neighbors force induced minimum degree at least six. The target
spectrum requires order at least 27.

```powershell
python -B attempts/wave16-n3-51-structural/exact_check.py `
  --verify attempts/wave16-n3-51-structural/exact-checks.json
python -B verification/n3-51-structural/independent_check.py
$wave16Python = (Resolve-Path '.venv\Scripts\python.exe').Path
Push-Location verification/n3-51-structural
& $wave16Python -B -m unittest -v test_independent_check.py
Pop-Location
```

The 24-test adversarial suite verifies the endpoint-local scope and contains
countercontrols against a global `H`-degree law, a point-size cap, the old
support-graph identity, reused support indices, and weakened spectral inputs.
It also pins the final Wave 15 public hash while preserving two transient
historical hashes. The verified conditional consequence is

```text
n3 >= 54,
induced_C6_count >= 209340,
Conway-99 = UNKNOWN,
novelty = UNKNOWN.
```

The computational lane is deliberately separate:

```powershell
python -B verification/n3-51-computation/independent_check.py `
  --output verification/n3-51-computation/independent-audit.json
python -B verification/n3-51-computation/test_independent_check.py -v
python -B code/wave16_n3_51_test.py -v
```

It independently rebuilds seven exact DIMACS streams, validates one positive
active-local relaxation candidate, rejects 38 hostile mutations, and passes
4 independent plus 8 submitted tests. Its final bounded status remains
`1 SAT_CANDIDATE / 5 TIMEOUT_UNKNOWN / 1 UNSAT_UNVERIFIED`, with one earlier
`BUDGET_UNKNOWN` retained separately. No solver-negative outcome is used as
mathematical evidence.

The independent literature/status audit is
`2026-07-23-wave16-status-audit.md`. It checks the exact source pages behind
`induced_C6_count=209286+n3`, current target-specific sources, exact-number
searches, corrections, citations, and the June 2026 Shpectorov lecture scope.
It found no target resolution or exact prior Wave 16 bound through 2026-07-23,
but correctly leaves both target status and novelty `UNKNOWN`.

The detached release replay is `2026-07-23-wave16-clean-clone.md`. It records
252 passing tests, six semantic checker entry points, five byte-identical
regenerations, all seven Wave 16 status hashes, every ledger evidence path,
public-hygiene scans, clean detached status, and `git fsck`.

## Wave 27 endpoint lattice and orthogonal-root audits

The Wave 27 verification package has three deliberately separated
mathematical layers.

First, the
[A2-summand-free construction audit](wave27-a2free-construction/2026-07-24T001657Z-audit.md)
independently reconstructs the abstract coupled package

```text
S=E8^4 orthogonal_sum E6^2
```

and passes 16 independent tests plus the submitted 15-test replay. Complete
root enumeration proves that `S` has no orthogonal `A2` direct summand.
Embedded `A2` root subsystems do occur inside its `E6` blocks; the audit
explicitly preserves that distinction. The verified object is still only a
candidate for the arithmetic/lattice relaxation, with no frame, projector,
Schur-square, or graph origin. The submitted account is the
[construction report](../agents/2026-07-23-wave27-a2free-construction.md).

Second, the
[unrestricted E6 trace audit](wave27-h9-classification/2026-07-24T002029Z-audit.md)
proves

```text
E6 Q=I (mod 2), Q symmetric even integral positive definite
  implies tr(E6 Q)>=14,
```

with equality attained by the displayed `Q6`. Its independent suite passes
21 tests and its submitted suite passes 16. The report retains one nonfatal
exposition correction, the missing parity bridge
`tr(C^2)=tr(C) (mod 2)`. This algebraic trace floor is not the later
projector-frame cubic floor: the trace-14 block is a valid hostile control for
the weaker algebraic problem. See the
[trace report](../agents/2026-07-23-wave27-h9-classification.md).

Third, the
[general-root tensor audit](wave27-general-root-tensor/2026-07-24T010548Z-audit.md)
uses an independent affine-CVP enumerator to verify cubic-energy floors 24
for an orthogonal `E6` summand and 66 for an orthogonal `A6` summand. The
`E6` floor contradicts its complement-imposed compression cap 22; the `A6`
floor exceeds the global trace 60. Arbitrary cross-block `Q` entries are
allowed, but every conclusion requires an orthogonal integral summand.

The frozen [core tensor report](../agents/2026-07-23-wave27-general-root-tensor.md)
leaves exactly `A20 orthogonal_sum E8^3` at `h=21` among 17 full rank-44 ADE
decompositions. A later, separately frozen
[A20 addendum](../agents/2026-07-24-wave27-a20-trace-addendum.md) proves a
local trace floor 42; the rank-24 complement raises the total floor to 66 and
excludes that core survivor. The audit verifies the core and addendum
separately, passing 23 independent, 17 submitted-core, and 8
submitted-addendum tests with byte-identical regenerations.

The combined conclusion is conditional on `n3=708`, the full projector/Schur
endpoint identities, and the additional hypothesis that the scaled-dual form
is a full orthogonal sum of irreducible ADE root lattices:

```text
full orthogonal ADE rank-44 endpoint form: impossible
general even rank-44 scaled-dual form: UNKNOWN
n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty: UNKNOWN
```

## Wave 34 exact encoding and actual-incidence continuation

Wave 34 has separated Stage 1, candidate, Stage 2, and crosscheck packages.

The rooted structural verifier binds the candidate coordinates to the exact
Wave 33 labeling, proves `SNF(P)=diag(1^13,0)`, reconciles the projector
splits, checks the integral rank-16 formulation in both directions, and
independently reproduces the `574,118,037` Pb-only column census. The
pair-census crosscheck derives the nine O-pair states directly and uses
weighted permanents to reproduce the stricter `448,879,368`
duplicate-free necessary-column count.

The rooted encoding verifier independently regenerates all 4,323,943 clauses
of the 1,233,001-variable complete-domain CNF and matches the raw
89,546,779-byte stream. This is encoding verification only. No SAT model,
UNSAT proof, or target graph exists in the package.

The rootless verifier reconstructs the fibre holonomy,
`deg(R2)=3q`, `deg(R3)=12-q`, `|E(R3)|=1150`, the 383-triangle upper cap,
mixed-trace normalization, and the partial control. The separate Stage 1
derivation records at least 6,860 R0-centered wedges, 3,041 four-cycles, and
`tr(A_R3^4)>=67848`. It does not force the forbidden motif.

The consolidated external-source package imports no graph-level theorem:
Kuber's Lean theorem is conditional without the graph bridge; Harrison's
formula identities replay but the theorem proof bodies are missing or
unpulled; Selub supplies historical SAT-framework prior art without a solver
certificate.

Run the 148 current-tree outer tests, the authenticated 11-test structural
chronology replay, the separate source validator, and the seven chronology
protocol tests with the commands in [`REPRODUCING.md`](../REPRODUCING.md).
The 16 publication manifests contain 130 entries. Exact corrections and
nonpromotion walls are in the
[Wave 34 orchestrator ledger](2026-07-24-wave34-orchestrator-corrections.md).

## Wave 29 single-lattice endpoint exclusion

The
[Wave 29 independent audit](wave29-s0-frame-exclusion/audit.md) reconstructs
the exact exclusion of only

```text
S0=K12 orthogonal_sum LAMBDA(F)
```

from the frozen full endpoint package. Minimum-four support gives 63 and 168
frame rows in the two blocks. Determinant allocation, the rank-12
even-unimodular veto, row-alphabet trace residues, and exact AM--GM force

```text
det(B_K)=3645,
tr(B_K)=24,
tr(C_K)=6.
```

`C_K` is integral and self-adjoint but is not assumed positive semidefinite.
The verifier checks the logarithmic inequality separately on
`(-1/2,0)` and `(0,infinity)`. Characteristic-pseudodeterminant integrality
then gives `det(B_K)<=729`, contradicting 3645.

The discovery and independent suites pass 18 and 27 tests, respectively.
Both results regenerate byte-identically, and all 14 mathematical manifest
entries validate. The verifier retains stale preinspection commit metadata,
the rejected PSD shortcut, exact determinant rounding, and active
premise-deletion controls.

The proof-separated
[literature audit](wave29-s0-literature-audit/audit.md) logs 81 query strings
in 21 batches, retains 16 primary or authoritative metadata records, and
finds standard ingredients but no exact combined prior result. One Crossref
query was rate-limited, and three major bibliographic services were not
comprehensively machine-audited. Novelty remains `UNKNOWN`.

The [correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave29-orchestrator-corrections.md)
records mathematical acceptance, wording and metadata corrections,
publication-byte normalization, source limits, and the exact scope wall:

```text
S0 full endpoint origin: REFUTED (VERIFIED)
every other h=729 lattice: UNKNOWN
n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty: UNKNOWN
```

The detached
[clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave29-clean-clone.md) passes all 45 tests,
two byte-identical regenerations, three manifests with 19 entries, central
metadata, all-repository local links, exact-blob privacy scans, clean status,
and strict Git object verification at integration commit
`ae8fd70baaeb35302f957653e20ad710e5e77281`.

Glued, non-root, and otherwise nonorthogonal general lattices are not
classified or excluded. The headline conditional bound therefore remains
`n3>=708`.

## Wave 30 decomposable `h=729` reduction and bare construction

The original
[general verifier audit](wave30-general-h729/audit.md) independently
reconstructs the conditional mathematics but records a submitted replay
failure. Discovery commit `091d0a4...` froze a transient Wave 29 audit hash,
so its submitted suite ran zero tests and its generator stopped before
output. Verifier-veto commit `0bc6dc9...` preserves `V30-GEN-001` and blocks
publication of that exact revision.

The provenance-only repair at `a7be6b8...` substitutes the applicable
committed hash and regenerates dependent result and checksum metadata. Its
test source, failed routes, mathematics, surviving type, and limitations are
unchanged. The
[fresh re-verification audit](wave30-general-h729/reverification-audit.md):

- freezes the exact repaired Git object;
- passes the repaired submitted suite `20/20`;
- reproduces its JSON byte for byte;
- reproduces the original zero-test/generator failure;
- passes the unchanged historical independent verifier `32/32` in the
  veto-commit snapshot; and
- reproduces the historical independent JSON byte for byte.

The repaired revision receives
`PASS_SCOPED_CONDITIONAL_THEOREM`; the original revision remains `FAIL`.
Within the full frozen `n3=708` endpoint hypotheses, fourteen of fifteen
aggregate types for a rootless, integrally orthogonally decomposable
rank-44 determinant-729 form are excluded. The unique surviving necessary
type has

```text
block ranks:       20,24
block det(S):      729,1
frame rows:        105,126
block det(Q):      5,1
block det(B):      3645,1
block tr(B):       36,24
B_U:               I24.
```

The local rank-20 block label is not the ADE root lattice `A_20` and is not
proved isometric to the construction below. The 62 surviving row-count
profiles are necessary arithmetic only.

The independent
[construction audit](wave30-h729-construction/audit.md) verifies five exact
2-neighbor steps from `K12 orthogonal_sum E8`, the complete root-count chain
`240 -> 112 -> 48 -> 20 -> 6 -> 0`, and a rootless rank-20 determinant-729
lattice `T20` with minimum four, exact level three, and exactly 5076
norm-four vectors. It also verifies the literal bare direct sum

```text
S44=T20 orthogonal_sum LAMBDA24,
G44=21*S44^(-1),
S44*G44=21*I44.
```

The construction discovery suite passes 16 tests and the independent
verifier passes 24 hostile tests. Both JSON results regenerate
byte-identically. No `Q`, compatible `B`, 105/126 frame, `X`, `M`, `W`,
Schur identity, endpoint, or graph is supplied.

The proof-separated
[literature audit](wave30-literature-audit/audit.md) freezes both exact
signatures, logs 96 query strings in 24 batches, and retains 21 structured
metadata records with no raw source payload. It finds no exact match in the
searched sources, records one Crossref HTTP 429 and incomplete bibliographic
coverage, and leaves novelty, priority, and global status `UNKNOWN`.

The
[orchestrator correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave30-orchestrator-corrections.md)
retains the original veto, repair, fresh verdict, verifier self-corrections,
construction packaging correction, discarded wrapper failures, source
limits, and publication wall:

```text
rootless integrally decomposable h=729 classification: VERIFIED
bare T20 and rank-44 S/G construction:                 VERIFIED
surviving 20+24 type / rooted / indecomposable:        UNKNOWN
h=729 row / n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty:              UNKNOWN
```

The detached
[Wave 30 clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave30-clean-clone.md) freezes
integration commit `0a31b62...` in a no-local, no-hardlink clone. It passes
60 tests in the repaired integration tree and 32 tests in the separately
extracted historical verifier snapshot, reproduces the original expected
zero-test/generator failure, regenerates four accepted JSON files byte for
byte, validates six manifests with 47 entries, and passes central-ledger,
link, exact-blob privacy, clean-status, and strict Git-object gates. Its scope
is reproducibility and publication hygiene for the conditional decomposable
reduction and bare `T20` construction only.

## Wave 31 sign-commutant obstruction and T20 finite boundary

The [primary sign-commutant audit](wave31-sign-commutant/audit.md) freezes
discovery commit `a8b0c34040f6857b3c5ebcc44f108e03a4159088` and independently
reconstructs the complete conditional proof. Under actual target
vertex-triangle incidence, a rootless integral orthogonal split induces a
nonempty proper triangle-coordinate projector block. Its diagonal sign
commutes with the zero-projector; transport by the incidence matrix produces
a symmetric graph operator commuting with the exact `-4` projector.

The full local commutator expansion gives constant signed vertex incidence.
The signed triangle double count forces `33 | b`, while the independent
projector-block trace argument forces `21 | b`. Hence `231 | b`, impossible
for a proper block. The primary verdict is `PASS_SCOPED`: 21 independent
tests pass, the submitted 15-test suite passes, and the submitted JSON
regenerates byte-identically.

The separate
[skeptical audit](wave31-sign-commutant-skeptic/audit.md) returns
`PASS_NO_FATAL_GAP`. It independently checks the contragredient unimodular
basis change, one-block row support, incidence eigenspace transport,
projector normalization, every local summand and sign, multiblock and
complement cases, both divisibility routes, and exact hostile controls.
It corroborates rather than replaces the designated verifier.

The resulting conditional status is:

```text
rootless integrally decomposable actual-incidence endpoint: impossible
Wave 30 20+24 survivor under those premises:                impossible
rooted endpoint forms:                                      UNKNOWN
rootless integrally indecomposable endpoint forms:          UNKNOWN
n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty:                               UNKNOWN
```

The independent
[T20 finite-evidence audit](wave31-t20-frame/audit.md) freezes construction
commit `67a0e4585c9c378dcd658784a3876564557b70e3`. Its separate
implementation enumerates the complete norm-four shell in two exact bases,
matches all 2,538 ordered antipodal lines, scans all 3,219,453 unordered
pairs, recomputes separate coefficient and augmented GF(2) ranks, verifies
all rational weights and 210 moments, and exhausts the named radius-one/two
domain with a collision-free base-257 encoding. The discovery and verifier
suites pass 10 and 11 tests.

Its verdict is `PASS_SCOPED_FINITE_EVIDENCE`. It verifies the exact
5,076-vector shell, pair geometry, 243-support rational box witness,
cap-one-coordinate exclusion, named radius-two nonhit, and conditional
84-unit `A4` transfer. It does not find or exclude an unrestricted Boolean
or oriented frame. The sign-commutant theorem independently supersedes this
as a rootless decomposable endpoint construction route without changing the
finite result.

The proof-separated
[literature audit](wave31-literature-audit/audit.md) preserves its
pre-verification chronology, logs 80 exact queries in 20 batches, makes four
direct metadata/abstract open attempts, retains 14 metadata records and no
raw source payload, and finds no exact prior result in searched sources.
That is not a novelty or openness certificate.

The
[Wave 31 correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave31-orchestrator-corrections.md)
records the primary-verifier wording correction, discarded wrong-directory
zero-test invocations, secondary-checker status, construction embedded-parent
hash, runtime-field portability caveat, literature chronology, logical
supersession, and unchanged global wall.

Six Wave 31 manifests contain 42 entries:

| package | entries | manifest SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| sign proof discovery | 7 | `c1d3b8d2a2ca25c4dcdb20fbc1d974f1561fa7c110524359443161d79bebd7f6` |

The detached
[Wave 31 clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave31-clean-clone.md) freezes
integration commit `f591e75...`. It passes 57 unit tests and the skeptical
checker, regenerates five accepted outputs, validates all 42 manifest
entries, checks the complete central ledgers and links, scans exact release
and new-blob bytes with zero privacy findings, and finishes with clean
detached status and strict Git-object integrity.

## Wave 32 rooted and indecomposable endpoint reductions

The corrected
[rooted discovery package](../attempts/wave32-rooted-vector/) proves a
necessary reduction under the full actual vertex-triangle incidence and
frozen `n3=708` endpoint package. Every norm-two root has triangle image

```text
(+1)^21,0^189,(-1)^21
```

transported from a signed seven-plus-seven vertex support whose induced
graph is, up to relabeling, the bipartite complement of the Fano incidence
graph. This reduces
the earlier `46 -> 32` root census to 16 matrix-only patterns and one
actual-incidence pattern. The package does not exclude that last pattern.

The [clean-room rooted audit](wave32-rooted-vector/audit.md) returns a scoped
`VERIFIED` verdict after 19 independent tests. It does not import or execute
discovery code. It reconstructs the primitive-image bridge, incidence
transport, residue elimination, support saturation, outside census, tensor
and fourth-moment constraints, reflection consequences, and hostile premise
deletions. It also preserves and repairs the discovery-v1 residual-degree
error; the corrected remaining degrees are `10,12,14`.

The separate
[indecomposable discovery package](../attempts/wave32-indecomposable/)
proves two necessary rootless reductions. Under minimum four, primitive row
generation makes integral indecomposability equivalent to connected
nonorthogonality support; the Wave 31 actual-incidence theorem supplies that
connectedness. Rootlessness also forbids the unique switched
`{-2,-2,-1}` three-row norm-two motif and forces

```text
tr(A_-1 A_-2^2)=0.
```

The [clean-room indecomposable audit](wave32-indecomposable/audit.md)
returns `PASS_SCOPED_WITH_NONBLOCKING_COVERAGE_GAPS` after 19 tests. It
independently supplies the checks omitted by the candidate suite, verifies
the exact pair census and factor-two trace normalization, and builds
full-size hostile controls. Neither pair counts nor those controls force the
motif under actual incidence.

The corrected [literature package](wave32-literature-audit/audit.md) and
[independent literature audit](wave32-literature-audit-independent/audit.md)
preserve 68 exact queries in 17 batches, eight direct inspections, 15
metadata records with explicit 14-plus-one chronology, three access
failures, and no raw source payload. The independent suite passes 17 tests
and records Petro--Phillips's conditional triangle spectrum as prior art.
No exact endpoint resolution was found in the searched sources; novelty,
priority, openness, and the global target status remain `UNKNOWN`.

Run the five suites from the repository root:

```powershell
python -B -m unittest discover -s attempts\wave32-rooted-vector -p test_exact_check.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave32-rooted-vector -p test_independent_check.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s attempts\wave32-indecomposable -p test_exact_check.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave32-indecomposable -p test_independent_check.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave32-literature-audit-independent -p test_independent_check.py -v
```

The exact test breakdown is `14 + 19 + 10 + 19 + 17 = 79`. Five
deterministic JSON outputs regenerate byte-identically. Six Wave 32
manifests contain 42 entries:

| package | entries | manifest SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| rooted discovery | 8 | `ba6c7099e06e24fe2feee4d19021dac9ddf49cbfe99acdd54f905a6c40728b8e` |
| rooted verifier | 7 | `2607c3000944e6d31ab5491a7d959ae4f97f05ac3e0d754baaf2830efcd085df` |
| indecomposable discovery | 7 | `451ca652a83b3a93fd11278c25dafe43bafabc3e06e1cac429064d32211d7138` |

The
[Wave 32 orchestrator correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave32-orchestrator-corrections.md)
retains every discovery defect, verifier objection, repair, scope wall, and
the unchanged global `UNKNOWN` status.

The detached
[Wave 32 clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave32-clean-clone.md) freezes
integration commit `ad6329f...`. It passes all 79 tests, regenerates five
accepted outputs, validates all 42 manifest entries, checks the complete
central ledgers and links, scans exact release and new-blob bytes with zero
privacy findings, and finishes with clean detached status and strict
Git-object integrity.

## Wave 33 finite rooted extension and rootless contraction wall

The [rooted extension audit](wave33-rooted-extension/comparison-audit.md)
independently verifies the conditional `14+70+15` equitable partition, the
simple `2-(15,3,2)` O-Q design, all six blocks of the exact strongly regular
graph-extension equation, and the forced induced-O spectrum. The criterion
is necessary and sufficient for a graph extension only; it does not certify
the remaining projector, lattice, tensor, or Schur endpoint conditions.
The precomparison and comparison suites pass `18+15=33` tests. No binary
solution and no complete infeasibility certificate is supplied.

The separate
[rooted construction audit](wave33-rooted-construction/audit.md) verifies
one hostile O-Q design, its ten exact `FB=2J` defects, and the precise scope
of a bounded search over all `70!` assignments of that one fixed design.
The package supplies no O-O layer. Its 25-second SciPy/HiGHS timeout has no
primal and carries no positive or negative evidence. The original local
frozen-context verifier recorded 37/37 and regenerated the hostile
certificate byte-identically. Chronology v2 replays 36 unchanged verifier
cases and separately passes the portable source half of the sole omitted
composite test. The
[chronology audit](wave33-rooted-construction-chronology/audit.md) preserves
every original byte, authenticates all eight historical inputs, and replays
the unchanged `14+36=50` portable construction cases in an isolated
temporary root. Its 20 outer hostile chronology tests pass. The portable
source half of the sole omitted composite verifier test passes separately.
The solver-environment half, which depends on ignored local files, is
`NOT_REPLAYED_NONBLOCKING`; v2 opens zero such files and observes zero
environment hashes. The unchanged comparison CLI is `NOT_RUN_BY_DESIGN`.
Direct live-root replay is expected to reject the later integrated
`STRUCTURE.md` byte.

The [rootless motif audit](wave33-rootless-motif/audit.md) returns
`PASS_SCOPED_WITH_NONBLOCKING_WORDING_QUALIFIER` after `21+27=48`
independent tests. At a formally allowed `q(T)=q(U)=2` `R2` pair, every
bilinear `Q[Gamma]` contraction and every `N^T p(A) N` contraction is blind
to the displayed null trade. The two formal nonnegative integral tables
have zero versus one common `R3` triangle. This does not establish global
realizability, occurrence, forcing, or avoidance, and it must not be
generalized to an unqualified statement about all two-leg contractions.
The exact actual-incidence board has four pair-indexed transversal
candidates, hence `4*708=2832` candidates with multiplicity rather than
2,832 distinct realized triangles.

Run the four live-input packages and the construction chronology package
from the integrated repository root:

```powershell
python -B -m unittest discover -s attempts\wave33-rooted-extension -p test_*.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s attempts\wave33-rootless-motif -p test_*.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave33-rooted-extension -p test_*.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave33-rootless-motif -p test_*.py -v
python -B -m unittest discover -s verification\wave33-rooted-construction-chronology -p "test_*.py" -v
```

The five commands report `15+14+33+48+20=130` outer tests. The chronology
suite performs one embedded `14+36=50` replay and separately passes the
portable source-provenance half of the sole omitted composite test. The
original historical package accounting remains
`15+14+14+33+48+37=161`; the v2 clean-clone-independent procedure reproduces
160 of those cases. The 20 chronology tests and embedded 50 original cases
are separate evidence layers.

The seven original artifact manifests contain 73 entries. The chronology
repair adds a seven-entry eighth manifest, for 80 entries in all:

| package | entries | manifest SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| rooted discovery | 8 | `153860d39fe7274a2f55ee952bcad1135cf4134ccc36d9aec07f6da379c5ca04` |

The
[Wave 33 orchestrator correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave33-orchestrator-corrections.md)
retains the discovery-report manifest typo, the construction replay
argument mistake, every verifier objection and checker gap, the mandatory
rootless wording qualifier, and the unchanged publication wall:

```text
rooted graph criterion:                  VERIFIED scoped
binary rooted solution or exclusion:    UNKNOWN
rootless fused-algebra/local reduction:  VERIFIED scoped
global mixed-motif forcing or avoidance: UNKNOWN
rooted/rootless endpoints:               UNKNOWN
n3=708 / Conway-99 / novelty:            UNKNOWN
```

The
[Wave 33 detached clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave33-clean-clone.md)
checks exact integration commit `66790bc` with 130 passing outer tests, eight
byte-identical external regenerations, eight manifests with 80 entries,
central-ledger/link/privacy gates, clean status, and strict Git object
verification.

The
[Wave 27 correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave27-orchestrator-corrections.md)
preserves the E6 exposition bridge, the corrected literature-protocol
interpretation, and the later A20-addendum chronology.

The proof-separated
[Wave 27 literature audit](wave27-literature-audit/audit.md) covers 56 frozen
or separately frozen service-query pairs and 303 inspected records through
2026-07-24. It records conceptual component and Cartan-matrix prior art, a
retained protocol correction, and failed-service results without treating
them as nonexistence evidence. No direct match was found within the bounded
search, but novelty and priority remain `UNKNOWN`.

The detached
[Wave 27 clean-source replay](2026-07-24-wave27-clean-clone.md) records 116
passing tests, seven byte-identical regenerations, six exact manifests,
central metadata and link gates, exact-blob privacy scans, clean status, and
strict Git object verification.

## Wave 28 unrestricted-lattice reductions and controls

Wave 28 has four independently separated packages.

The
[glue/discriminant audit](wave28-glue-discriminant/audit.md) reconstructs
the elementary 3- and 7-primary discriminant groups, exact levels, twelve
formal Milgram-compatible quadratic modules, scaled-dual local signs,
single-root complement theorem, primitive root-closure/glue reduction, and
the exact `46 -> 32` root-image pattern census. Its verdict is
`PASS_WITH_CORRECTION`: the frozen discovery report falsely excludes cyclic
order-21 invariant factors. The correct statement permits order 21 while
excluding `p`-primary factors of order `p^2` or higher.

The
[theta/modular audit](wave28-theta-modular/audit.md) independently checks all
eight levels and characters, the Poisson/Weil conventions, Sturm bounds,
modularity vetoes, ADE controls, and the rootless bare lattice

```text
K12 orthogonal_sum LAMBDA(F).
```

A complete fraction-free closed-ellipsoid recursion visits 15,053,011 nodes
and finds all 146,880 norm-four vectors of `LAMBDA(F)`. The resulting
rank-44 control has determinant 729, no roots, 147,636 norm-four vectors, and
exact scaled-dual minimum 28. Its finite discriminant quadratic module is
explicitly isometric to that of the rooted comparator
`E6^6 orthogonal_sum E8`. This verifies that the bare data do not force a
root; it does not construct the endpoint frame.

The
[simultaneous-neighbor audit](wave28-simultaneous-neighbor/2026-07-24-wave28-simultaneous-neighbor-audit.md)
reconstructs two rational basis changes of the Wave 27 paired-form package,
all transformed matrices, both root cosets, ADE components, primitive
closures, and glue indices. The preferred neighbor has root rank 43; the
retained initial neighbor has root rank 44. Both are abstract arithmetic and
lattice controls only.

The proof-separated
[literature audit](wave28-literature-audit/audit.md) executes all 35 frozen
queries, retains 17 metadata-only source records and two explicit access
limitations, and finds no exact target resolution or combined Wave 28
precedent. A 2025 refereed source calls the problem open, and a 2026 SAT
preprint reports no resolution. Non-discovery does not establish novelty,
priority, or openness after the cutoff.

The five mathematical suites pass, in discovery/verification order,

```text
13, 14, 16, 20, 25 tests: 88 total.
```

All 46 entries of the six Wave 28 manifests validate. The
[correction ledger](2026-07-24-wave28-orchestrator-corrections.md) records
the order-21 prose defect, the stale eleven-form count, freeze and mutation
chronology, non-evidentiary direct-enumeration timeout, metadata repair,
theta preprocessing failures, source-retention boundary, and telemetry
packaging repair.

The detached
[clean-clone replay](2026-07-24-wave28-clean-clone.md) passes all 88 tests,
five byte-identical regenerations, six manifests with 46 entries, central
metadata, all-repository local links, exact-blob privacy scans, clean status,
and strict Git object verification at integration commit
`4c4d2cb8dec14c7834984d47a7e5b29991891e60`.
