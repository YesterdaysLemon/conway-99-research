## Handoff

The three external-source lanes pass only at their explicit boundaries.

- Current direct sources support the maintained `?` status marker, McKay's
  approximate design-scale statement, and the restricted provenance of the
  Rijeka derived corpus. None proves openness, completeness, or novelty.
- Kuber's pinned Lean project builds cleanly and verifies a conditional
  matrix/arithmetic theorem with standard Lean axioms. It does not formalize
  the graph-to-matrix bridge.
- Harrison's arbitrary-root model, builder separation, orbit coverage,
  forcing layer, exact Gram base, and 1,302 CNF recipe identities replay.
  Missing or unpulled proof bodies leave every theorem-ladder UNSAT claim
  `UNKNOWN`.
- Selub is valid historical SAT-framework prior art but reports no solver
  result or certificate. The printed quadrilateral equivalence is
  `NOT VERIFIED AS PRINTED`.

No external graph-level result is imported. Conway-99, `n3=708`, novelty, and
priority remain `UNKNOWN`.

The full consolidation is
