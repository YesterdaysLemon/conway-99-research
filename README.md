# Conway 99 Research

An open, reproducible research project on the existence of a strongly regular
graph with parameters `srg(99,14,1,2)`.

> **Research disclaimer:** This repository contains exploratory research and
> internally checked candidates, not peer-reviewed mathematical results.

## Frozen target

Determine whether there is a finite simple undirected graph on 99 vertices in
which every vertex has degree 14, every adjacent pair has exactly one common
neighbor, and every nonadjacent pair has exactly two common neighbors.

For a symmetric binary adjacency matrix `A` with zero diagonal, the target is
equivalently

```text
A^2 = 12 I - A + 2 J.
```

John H. Conway phrased the question as asking for a 99-vertex graph in which
every edge belongs to a unique triangle and every nonedge belongs to a unique
quadrilateral. See [CONJECTURE.md](CONJECTURE.md) for conventions, equivalences,
and the normalized search problem.

## Current status

- **Literature status:** open as of the audit dated 2026-07-22.
- **Project status:** `EXPLORATORY`.
- **Resolution claim:** none.
- **Symmetry policy:** no nontrivial automorphism, transitivity, Cayley, or
  circulant assumption is imposed on the full search.

A peer-reviewed 2025 paper calls existence an open problem. A targeted
freshness search through 2026-07-22 found no credible construction or
nonexistence proof. That search is evidence about the literature, not a
mathematical proof of openness.

## Why the search has 84 vertices

Fix a root `x`. Its 14 neighbors induce seven disjoint edges. Each of the other
84 vertices is canonically labeled by one of the 84 nonedges among those 14
neighbors. The unknown part is therefore a 12-regular graph on those 84 labels,
subject to exact common-neighbor constraints. This normalization removes
labeling redundancy without assuming that a solution has any automorphisms.

## Research lanes

1. **Statement and literature:** freeze definitions, reproduce known
   restrictions, and audit current status.
2. **Structural proof attacks:** derive constraints from the 84-vertex
   residual graph, its incidence matrix, spectra, codes, and local subgraphs.
3. **Construction/counterexample search:** exact-cover, SAT/PB, constraint
   programming, and heuristic candidate generation.
4. **Adversarial verification:** independent checkers, proof certificates,
   small-instance calibration, and explicit attempts to falsify every claim.

The orchestrator keeps discovery and verification separate. Agent prose is not
evidence by itself; only cited mathematics, checked derivations, reproducible
computations, or independently verifiable certificates may raise a claim's
status.

## Evidence labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CITED` | A precise source is given; the project has not independently proved it. |
| `DERIVED` | A complete human-checkable derivation is recorded. |
| `VERIFIED` | Independent code or formal checking reproduced the claim. |
| `CANDIDATE` | Worth testing; not established. |
| `REFUTED` | A recorded check found a concrete defect or counterexample. |
| `UNKNOWN` | Neither proved nor refuted here. |
